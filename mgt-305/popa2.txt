Go to www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm and take the Jung Typology Test or complete the handout survey. 

## Part one
- [x] Write a brief summary of your results and your feelings about them.  Some ideas to include:
- [x] How accurate you think the results were
- [x] What is says about your personality type
- [x] Personal insights you gained
## Part two:
- [x] How do your Myers Briggs Results compare to the Big Five from Self-Assessment 3.1?  Is it more or less accurate (in your opinion).
### Part three:
- [x] How do your personality results shape your career plans?
- [x] List some the careers that appear on the Myers Briggs result for you and write a brief statement of what you think of the list, e.g. how well it predicts the career you have or are working towards as well as how it can influence your/others workplace behaviors.
- [ ] Please be sure to include as your sources which survey(s) you used to get your results.  The two attachments offer a much more clear overview of career information than the online survey.
